// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the requirements of our program are layed out and decided. This is where developers will decide how they are going to write the software."
const design = "This is the third step, where the software has had the requirements and the goal defined and its time to actually write it"
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fourth step, where as you are writing the code you are constantly testing and integrating and rewriting until you reach your programs goal. "
const implementation = "This is the fifth step, here is where we have already tested and made sure everything works properly and now we actually need to permanantly add these changes to the code so when it runs it runs how we want it too."
const maintain = "This is the final step, this is where weve written the code and it works properly but if we need to add any new goals to this program we need to make sure that the program still works properly. thus maintaining it."
